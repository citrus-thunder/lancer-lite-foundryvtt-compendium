    "description": "<p>The heaviest hardsuits. They are always powered and up-armored with thick, composite armor. Heavy hardsuits often feature integrated weapons, powerful mobility suites, and -- by augmenting their user's strength -- allow their user to field much heavier weapons than normal infantry can typically carry. Heavy hardsuits are in decline now that half-size chassis are popular, but they are still common among private militaries and middle-tier Diasporan armed forces.</p>",
