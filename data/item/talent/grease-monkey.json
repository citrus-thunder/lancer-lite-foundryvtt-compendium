Additionally, when you&nbsp;<strong>LOCK ON</strong>, you learn your target's&nbsp;<strong>ARMOR, SPEED, EVASION, E-DEFENSE, MECH SKILLS,</strong> and current&nbsp;<strong>HP</strong>, and can share this information with allies.</p>\n<h2>Rank III: Bentham/Foucault Elimination</h2>\n<p>As a&nbsp;<strong>quick action</strong> when you&nbsp;<strong>LOCK ON</strong>, you may nominate an allied character adjacent to you: they may immediately make any&nbsp;<strong>quick action</strong> as a&nbsp;<strong>reaction</strong>, consuming your target's&nbsp;<strong>LOCK ON</strong> condition. Their action does not need to be an attack, but they benefit from consuming the&nbsp;<strong>LOCK ON</strong> condition if they do choose to attack.</p>",
